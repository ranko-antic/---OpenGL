# OpenGL Project
Computer Graphics / Faculty of Electrical Engineering (University of Tuzla)

## Specification
The goal of this project is to write a program that renders a 3D articulated object (eg a hand), with lighting, texture and
with a simple animation such as opening and closing a fist. The hand is renderable
as a group of boxes. Use hierarchical transformations (such as glPushMatrix() and
glPopMatrix()). Code should be structured in an object-oriented style.
